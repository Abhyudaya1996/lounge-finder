# Lounge Genius To-Do List

## âœ… 1. Use Original Lounge Photos - COMPLETED
- Lounge photos are located in `public/lovable-uploads/` with the naming convention `lounge_<lounge_id>_<img_no>.jpg`.
- For the main lounge listing (first page), always use the first image (`img_no = 1`) for each lounge.
- On the lounge detail page (second page), create a carousel of all images for that lounge.
- If no image is found for a lounge, use the default image: `public/lovable-uploads/e54585c7-7f5f-4ac5-9085-1e462e89b9e2.png`.

**Implementation Details:**
